                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am Lujain Elmallah and I am currently a student studying Interactive Media and Computer Science at NYU Abu Dhabi. With an interest in web development and user experience development, I have been delving into the different possible ways to create an interactive experience. Over the past few weeks, I have worked on several projects that explore such concepts, creating in total four projects each exploring a different form of media. Focusing on how to transform simple media into a holistic interactive experience. I'm passionate about <span id="interest" class="highlight">coding</span>, <span id="another-interest" class="highlight">designing</span>, and <span id="third-interest" class="highlight">creating</span>.</p>
